\chapter{Machine Learning}
Data science is mostly turning business problems into data problems and collecting
data and understanding data and cleaning data and formatting data, after which
machine learning is almost an afterthought.
\section{Modeling}

What is a model? It’s simply a specification of a mathematical (or probabilistic) relationship that exists between different variables.

\section{What Is Machine Learning?}

Everyone has her own exact definition, but we’ll use machine learning to refer to creating and using models that are learned from data. In other contexts this might be
called predictive modeling or data mining, but we will stick with machine learning.

We’ll look at both supervised models (in which there is a set of data labeled with the
correct answers to learn from) and unsupervised models (in which there are no such
labels). There are various other types, like semisupervised (in which only some of the
data are labeled), online (in which the model needs to continuously adjust to newly
arriving data), and reinforcement (in which, after making a series of predictions, the
model gets a signal indicating how well it did) that we won’t cover here.
