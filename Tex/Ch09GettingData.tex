\chapter{Getting Data}
\section{stdin and stdout}
If you run your Python scripts at the command line, you can pipe data through them
using \verb|sys.stdin| and \verb|sys.stdout|.

在Windows中的命令行可以输入：
\begin{pyc}
    type line_count.txt | python egrep.py "[0-9]"
    type line_count.txt | python line_count.py
    type line_count.txt | python egrep.py "[0-9]" | python line_count.py
\end{pyc}

The $\mid$ is the pipe character, which means “use the output of the left command as the
input of the right command.” You can build pretty elaborate data-processing pipelines
this way.
